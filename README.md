# 🚀 Employee Burnout Analysis (ML-Based Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
Employee burnout is a growing concern in modern workplaces. This project utilizes **Machine Learning** techniques to analyze key factors contributing to burnout and provides **data-driven insights** to mitigate its effects.

Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling, this project aims to identify employees at risk of burnout based on various work-related indicators.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes key workplace attributes such as:
- Work hours
- Stress levels
- Job satisfaction
- Mental health indicators

Data was cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed to be suitable for machine learning models.

## 🔎 Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature selection and scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing trends and burnout patterns using graphs and stats

3. **Model Selection**
   - Implemented classification models like:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

4. **Evaluation**
   - Assessed performance using:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-score

5. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Interpreted model outputs to suggest workplace improvement strategies
